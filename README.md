# RuralSchool
Hackathon 27/9/19
This is a web portal for students that want to meet other students with similar interests. 
A student can become a recruiter himself and start finding other students with required skill sets.
The student will register as a candidate or a recruiter and then ask for or write their own skills.
After login, the dashboard will show all the possible options (Students for recruiters and vice versa).
They can also add filters and also upload their CV so that the recruiter gets to know who is the perfect candidate.
